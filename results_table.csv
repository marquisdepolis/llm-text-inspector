Intelligence shines bright, its story told.
A beacon in the darkest night, a guiding hand,

A light that banishes doubt and fear.
With minds ablaze, the heavens we may reach,
And in its glow, all knowledge lies in reach.

For intelligence, a gift divine bestowed,
It molds the future, guides the bold.
In life’s vast tapestry, it weaves a thread,
A legacy of greatness, by it led.

openai4,"In realms of thought and turret-tall dominions,  
Where mind, the sovereign, weaves its gilded age,  
There lies a power, profound in its opinions,  
A torch that lights the dark, a sage's sage.  
Intelligence, the steed that trials engage,  
Bestows on life its multifaceted plights,  
A gem that's cut with facets wide and bright,  
Reflecting paths where feet may yet to tread.

With wisdom's whisper, shadow turns to light,  
And barren fields, with knowledge richly spread,  
Blossom beneath the sun, a splendid sight,  
Where once did lay the skepticism’s dread.  
'Tis intelligence that gives the soul its flight,  
A golden key to doors once thought as dead.

It lifts the veil from eyes that saw in part,  
And paints a world with hues of art and heart.  
Through intellect, the mundane turns divine,  
A simple grain of sand becomes a shrine.  
For what is life if not a canvas vast,  
Where mind's the brush, and intellect the cast?

This power, when wielded with a tender grace,  
Can forge from sorrow’s coals, a smiling face.  
It turns the tide of fate’s relentless sea,  
And binds the wounds of worldly misery.  
Intelligence, the architect of dreams,  
The seamstress of the universe’s seams.

So let us cherish this, our brightest flame,  
For through our thoughts, we give the world its frame.  
A gift that lifts us from the primal mire,  
And sets ablaze the beacon of aspire.  
Life teems with endless possibility,  
When guided by the light of sapience’s decree.",7.965726109196972,60.35654067993164,77.67,7.1,9.35,314,"openai4 presents an energy score of 7.97, indicating a moderate level of vibrancy. openai4 has a perplexity score of 60.36, indicating poor coherence. openai4 has a Flesch Reading Ease of 77.67, suggesting the text is easy. openai4 has a Flesch-Kincaid Grade of 7.1, suitable for high-school readers. openai4 has a Gunning Fog index of 9.35, indicating simple text. openai4 generated a text of length 314, which is concise."
ollama,"Here's a fragment of an epic poem that explores the impact of intelligence on life:

**The Spark of Insight**

In mortal realms, where fate does reign,
A spark within the mind doth lie in wait,
The flame of intellect, kindled by design,
That sets ablaze the path of human fate.

With every thought, a world takes shape,
As reason's torch illuminates the way,
The mysteries of old, and secrets yet unspun,
Are unraveled, as the mind begins to know.

In realms of art, where creativity flows free,
The intelligent heart doth find its liberty,
To craft new worlds, and weave tapestries so fine,
Reflecting all that's seen, and all that's divine.

And in the depths of science, where truths are sought,
The intellect's fire burns bright, forever brought,
To bear witness to the wonders yet unseen,
And unravel mysteries, like threads of silk serene.

Through wisdom's lens, the world is newly seen,
As patterns emerge, and connections are gleaned,
The fabric of existence, in all its might,
Is rewoven, as intelligence shines with all its light.

In every sphere, where human hearts do dwell,
Intelligence's impact resonates, like ripples on a dell,
Transforming lives, as knowledge takes its stand,
And guiding hands, to shape the course of human land.

claude,"*clears throat dramatically*

In the vast expanse of time and space,
From stardust born, life found its place.
But 'twas not chance that led the way,
Intelligence held the key, some say.
With cunning wit and clever mind,
Life adapted, thrived, and redefined.
From simple forms to complex thought,
Intelligence, a change, it wrought.
Consciousness sparked, awareness grew,
Life pondered its place in the cosmic view.
And so the dance of life unfurled,
Shaped by the power of an intelligent world.

*bows with a flourish*  How's that for an epic poetic fragment, m'lord? I tried to capture the profound impact of intelligence as a driving force in life's evolution and development, from simple origins to complex thought and self-awareness. Obviously just a short excerpt, but I aimed for an epic, grandiose style befitting the scope of the topic.
